# Clustering-Visualizer
Visulaize and see some of the  famous clustering algorithms when they run.
This is a native python project and uses python environment and libraries to run.

Following Python libraries are required to run the code on your machine:
pygame
numpy
python 3.x (prefered 3.7.7 or higher)

pygame is an python library used to buld 2d games, we can install it using pip or python3 command run any of the following command
pip intall pygame
python3 -m pip install -U pygame --user

Make sure pygame is installed successfully. Also if you run on python 3.7.7 or higher it will be better.I ran on python 3.8 and it worked well on my machine.


Once pygame is installed you are ready to run the program.
Before running make sure to put all the files in a single folder.
Going in this folder run the following command:
python runner.py


If every thing goes well this should open an pygame window on your screen looking like this:
